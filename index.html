    <p>Welcome! Can't see much on the surface? That's OK, there are some useful links, a little info about me, and plenty of projects if you want to take a scroll. There's even a small blog in the subdomains if you're interested.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm Sam, I have a Bachelors degree in Computer Science and was born in 1996 (which makes me part of the midway generation, or a zillenial if you like). I remember the change from using dialup to "broadband" and now gigabit internet. Since before I was a teenager I've had an interest in coding and making my own things. In high school I handwrote a darts scoring website while everyone else used a WYSIWG editor! It's unfortunately not around anymore but since then both my skills and the technologies used have grown exponentially.</p>
    <p>I started off by learning and using PHP along with raw HTML, JavaScript, CSS and MySQL, but now have experience in NodeJS (React, Express), MongoDB amongst others and am moving to use docker and docker-compose throughout my stack.</p>
